# About the Project
The project I build is “Note Taking Website App Using Pure JavaScript.” We all have a notes app on our mobiles or laptop. Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could.

## Setting up the Project
The project setup is really simple. Because I only wanted to use JavaScript without any frameworks. Start by creating a new project folder in VS Code, and inside that project folder, I created two empty new files: index.html and app.js. The index.html file is the entry point for our website and contains the HTML code. In this project, I also used Bootstrap. 

## Bootstrap
- I used Bootstrap for applying styling the user interface components. The easiest way to include Bootstrap is to add it from --> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/.
- Bootstrap is bundled with many components that can be used to provide good user experience and user interactions in a web page like cards, navigation bars, dropdowns, icons, buttons, forms and also sizing options for different DOM elements. In this project, I used bootstrap components for making the front end of website. Then after desiging the website, I added logic into it using pure javaScript.
